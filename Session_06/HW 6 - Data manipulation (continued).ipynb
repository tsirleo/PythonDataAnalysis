    "1. Process all the files in the \"Data/LS_MS NL\" folder: extract all peak's isotope ratios and put this information in a pandas DataFrame. Use hierarchical indexing to be able to attribute different information to the acquired data (e.g. aminoacid name, sample name, dilution). Try to select the most convinient way to store all the information about the peaks in one DataFrame.\n",

    "4. For a given retention time output all the samples names, which have a peak detected at specified retention time.\n",
    "5. Group all the corresponding peaks of certain aminoacid detected in different samples by getting the mean value for every mass across all the corresponding samples. You might have to do something about missing values. "

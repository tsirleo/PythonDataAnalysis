    "Perfrom clustering analysis on any of the time series data from the  \"Data/LS_MS Data CSV\" folder, which contains at least two separate peaks. The goal of this analysis is to cluster retention time points into clusters, which correspond to the regions with different peak's and regions with just background noise. Output clusters as corresponding retention time ranges. Visualize the results against initial time-series plots.\n",

The data is presented in tab-delimeted format, where each column corresponds to the values of the minimized function's variables and columns correspond do different rounds of minimization. Pick any file and perform clustering analysis. The goal is to find clusters, which correspond to the local minima of the minimized function.
